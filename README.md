I made this website for Dajia Farmer Association as their rice inventory management system.  
Backend is built with an NodeJS CMS called KeystoneJS and this CMS use MongoDB as its database.  
Frontend is mainly built with Angular1 and bootstrap3.  

If you have any question, please feel free to contact me.  

There are the following features implemented:
1. Use document-based MongoDB to manage farmers' profile and their accounts containing the amount of money that came from selling their rice to Farmer Association.  
2. Facilitate accounting aggregation by calculating the sales information from database.(MongoDB Aggregation)  
3. Output pdf file and fill in part of information based on data coming from database.
